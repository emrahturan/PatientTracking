The first program I developed when I started programming. I developed the Patient Tracking System with the C ++ language. The program performs the following operations.

* Add patient
* Edit patient
* Delete patient
* Add appointment
* Edit an appointment
* Delete appointment
* Patient interrogation (patient's general, appointment and medication information)
* Patient list
* Create Examination
